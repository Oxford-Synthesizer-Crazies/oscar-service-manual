# Overview

The Oxford Synthesizer Company OSCar is a digital-analog hybrid synthesizer,
with both subtractive and additative synthesis, an arpeggiator and a sequencer,
and an early MIDI implementation, although there may be synthesizers out there that doesn't have the MIDI add on.

It was designed by Chris Hugget and manufactured between 1983 and 1985. Less than a thousand was manufactured.

## Servicing the OSCar

The OSCar has a multitude unique design features, many of them based in a desire to keep the price down.
As such even opening it can be a challenge, as it's not designed like any other synthesizer.
There are also some bits of it that are fragile, so care needs to be taken.

In general, it is highly recommended that you let an synth repair expert with experience of OSCars do the work for you.

You should be especially careful with the rubber separators, the CPU (green) circuit board and the IC sockets. 

The rubber separators can lose their elasticity, especially if they have seen a lot of sun.
The CPU circuit board is very heat sensitive and it's easy to damage it when soldering.
The IC sockets are brittle, maybe because of age, and can crack. 
They also require quite a high insertion force, so you should use tools both for IC removal and insertion in order to not damage the legs of the IC's.
