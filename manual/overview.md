# Overview

The Oxford Synthesizer Company OSCar is a digital-analog hybrid synthesizer,
with both subtractive and additative synthesis, an arpeggiator and a sequencer,
and an early MIDI implementation, although there may be synthesizers out there that doesn't have the MIDI add on.

It was designed by Chris Hugget and manufactured between 1983 and 1985. Less than a thousand was manufactured.
