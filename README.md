# OSCar Service Manual
The OSCar service manual is a Github repository that collects information on how to service the Oxford Synthesizer Company OSCar. The long term goal is to be able to generate an HTML and/or PDF manual on the synthesizer internals, replacement parts, difficult areas, etc.

## Contributors needed!

The aim of this repository is to gather information collaboratively. If it becomes a one-man operation it will die.
Any information you can add, please do so. You can contribute in the following ways:

1. Fork this repository, update it and make a pull request. This is the recommended way.

2. Ask for write permissions to the repository and add the changes directly here. If you are a person with proven knowledge of the OSCar, like someone who has done repairs on OSCars, or if you have made good pull requests before (see point 1) I'll give you access. This is good if you plan to add a lot, but over a long time.

3. Mail me whatever you think should be added. This is the worst option, as I don't have a lot of time.

4. For factual errors, you can create an issue.
